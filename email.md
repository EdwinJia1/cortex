Hello students!

I know you are not only passionate about sharing your knowledge and skills with the next generation, but also incredibly talented and creative.
Day of AI Australia, in partnership with UNSW, is excited to invite you to the Design a GenAI Game Competition. We're looking for innovative individuals and teams to create a Generative AI-powered game that will help high school students develop crucial AI literacy skills. The game will be included in the Day of AI Australia program in 2026, and made available to our international partners.

On offer is a cash prize of $5,000 as well as the opportunity to work with us to further develop the game.

You can work with up to two other people (who don't need to be Champions or even studying at UNSW).

Below are more details about the competition. 

Deadline to submit your entry is Sunday 21 September.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask!

Design a GenAI Game for Day of AI Australia

Develop a concept and a working prototype for a web application or interactive game aimed at students in Years 7-10. Your game should demystify at least one fundamental AI concept or AI literacy skill in a way that is fun, creative, and intuitive.

What is AI Literacy? It’s not about coding or computer science fundamentals. It’s about understanding what AI is, how it works, and its societal impact. Think about concepts like data bias, model hallucinations, human-in-the-loop processes, and the responsible use of AI. We want to empower students to think critically and engage safely with the AI tools shaping their world.

The Competition: Key Details

Your Task: Design and build a prototype of an educational game powered by Generative AI.

Inspiration: Think of simple, powerful experiences like Google's Teachable Machine or Quick, Draw!, or games that tackle complex topics like Harmony Square (disinformation). We want your original ideas, but here are some concepts you could explore:

Model Behaviour: Hallucinations, Overfitting, Bias in Models

Generative AI Concepts: Latent Space, Temperature, Attention Mechanism, Context Windows

Ethics & Safety: Explainable AI, Privacy, Adversarial Attacks, Transparency, Human-in-the-Loop

Data: The importance of Data Quality, Feature Engineering

Crucial Design Constraints: Your game must be:

Fun, creative, and intuitive.

Accessible (WCAG guidelines).

Safe and age-appropriate for high school students.

Critically, it must avoid free text input/output to ensure child safety.



The Prize

The winning individual or team will receive:

A $5,000 cash prize.

The opportunity to work with a UNSW Engineering team to develop and refine your prototype for real-world use in Australian classrooms.



How to Enter

Your submission must include three components:

The Video Demo (Max 3 mins): This is the most important part! Create an engaging video showing your game in action. It must be publicly viewable via a link (e.g., YouTube).

The Technical Writeup (PDF): Your proof of work. An engineering report explaining your architecture, your specific use of Generative AI, safety measures, and technical choices.

Public Code Repository (e.g., GitHub): A link to your well-documented codebase for validation. A link to a live, working deployment is highly encouraged.

Who Can Enter?

Individuals or teams of up to three.

At least one team member must be either:

A UNSW student currently enrolled in a Computer Science and Engineering unit, OR

A current or past Day of AI Australia Classroom Champion.

Timeline

Final Submission Deadline: 23:59 AEST, Sunday 21 September 2025

Winner Notified: By Friday 26 September 2025



Judging Criteria

Your entry will be judged by a panel including experts from UNSW, Day of AI Australia, and Google.

Originality (30%): Is the concept novel and creative?

Relevance (30%): Does it effectively teach an AI literacy concept and fit the curriculum?

Technical Depth & Execution (30%): Is the use of Gen AI innovative? Is the demo backed by real, verifiable code?

Communication (10%): How clear and engaging is your submission?

This is a fantastic opportunity to build your portfolio, contribute to a meaningful educational project, and be recognized for your creativity and technical skills.
